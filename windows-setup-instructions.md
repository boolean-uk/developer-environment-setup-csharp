## Tips

You need a fair bit of space on your c drive to install.  I'd say at least 12 gig!   

You can customise the items that get installed.  At the moment just go with the default as it may be tempting to install more than you'll ever need!  This install dialog can 
be run at anytime afterwards to customise (Visual Studio Installer).  Go with the default, kick it off and go get a coffee.
